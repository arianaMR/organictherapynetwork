# Redux Listener Middleware

A Redux middleware that acts as a gerneral listener on actions
that are dispatched to the Redux store.

## installing the middleware

The middleware itself can handle multiple listeners at the same time,
so it needs to be applied only once 

```js
import listen from 'redux-listener-middleware';

const middleware = listen(); //get a new instance of the middleware

const store = createStore( //redux default
  reducer, // your very own reducer
  applyMiddleware( // redux standard
    thunk, // other middleware probably should be chained BEFORE the interceptor
    middleware // interceptor middleware
  )
);
```

## creating a listener

As a second step, the middleware can be augmented with listeners working
on incoming actions.

```js
const middleware = listen(); // we've seen this berfore
middleware.createListener((action, dispatch) => { // the action and redux's dispatch are handed over
  doSomethingWithThe(action)
    .then(payload => dispatch({type: 'ASYNC_ACTION', payload})) // so yo can dispatch other actions anytime later on
});
```

## creating rules for the listener

Per se the listener doesn't react on any
