Type Definition and constants for Contentful Rich Text.

Block constants partially taken from [markup-it](https://github.com/GitbookIO/markup-it).

## Releases flow (Atomatic Releases)

Automatic releases are possible thanks to [semantic release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release), which publishes the code automatically on npm and generates a changelog.

We follow [angular commit format](https://gist.github.com/stephenparish/9941e89d80e2bc58a153#allowed-type) to generate a changelog.

You'll need to use `npm run commit`, to create conventional commits.
